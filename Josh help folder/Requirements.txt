    Question:

    [INSERT QUESTION]?

    [1] Yes
    [2] No
    [0] Exit

    Enter your option: [_]
    """

# How the ID's for each question is formatted

    - Every question has an ID:

        [CATEGORY] + [Primary Question Level] + [Secondary Question Level] + [Tertiary Question Level]

    - With this format, it would look like this:

        [XX][00][00][00]

    - Example:

        ED010201 - (Education Category, the first tertiary question of the 2nd secondary question that falls under the first primary question)
        PH200106 - (Photography Category, the sixth tertiary question of the 1st secondary question that falls under the twentieth primary question)

# How the data is formatted

    "Question_ID"   "Q_Level"     "Tier_Name"       "ID"    "Category_Name"                 "[Level]" 

    XX000000	    Title	        [Tier Name]	    XX	    [Category Name]	                [CATEGORY NAME]			
    XX010000	    Primary	        [Tier Name]	    XX	    [Category Name]		                [Primary Question]

    XX010101	    Tertiary	    [Tier Name]	    XX	    [Category Name]				                [Tertiary Question]
