16.4 Practice Lab 4
A business requires that each employee ID begins with a department identifier and ends with an individual identifier (e.g., "HRD00123", "ENG00567"). The department identifier is a 3-letter department code in all uppercase. The individual identifier is a 5-digit numeric value.

Complete the Python script to create a custom function name validate_id. The function should accept a string parameter representing an employee ID, determine if the ID meets the requirements, and return a Boolean value, with True returned if all requirements are met and False returned if any requirement is not met.

Only the validate_id function will be graded for this assessment. The function should work for any string representing an ID passed to validate_id beyond the examples provided.

Example: If the string representing an employee ID is

HRD00123
the expected return is

True
Example: If the string representing an employee ID is

Ops123456
the expected return is

False
